## Decoupled Kit Application from Acquia

### About 

This is a starter application built as a baseline for creating React applications which rely heavily on API data from external sources. This application was forked from the [React Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) application and the full documentation has been moved in `docs\React-Slingshot.md`. This application has included a considerable amount of features to be leveraged as best practices around workflow, structure, testing, and much more. The examples are intentionally basic to provide clarity around the intents of the components.

### Installation 

- Install <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/">yarn</a> or also use `npm` for dependencies.
- Install packages with `yarn install` or `npm install`
- Stand up the application with `yarn start` or `npm start` and visit `http://localhost:8080`

Complex CRUD operations in Drupal 8

Extending core REST with REST plugins

Drupal as a single data source: GraphQL and JSON API
- content types simple showing thru api 

Synthesizing non-Drupal and Drupal API data with GraphQL // Multiple data sources: Handing non-Drupal API data // Best practices in correlating data from multiple API sources

Proxying data into Drupal via JSON API and JavaScript middleware

Common issues in rate limiting and API failure // Caching data in non-Drupal APIs for API failover


Mocking APIs for local application development



have little hover ? explaning what component does
