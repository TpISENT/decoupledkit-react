## User Roles in Drupal
One of the most basic ways to administer user Web Site permissions through Drupal is by creating roles.

Rather than assigning individual permissions to each user, permissions are assigned to roles, and roles are assigned to users. Using roles gives administrators greater control over permissions, making it easy to assign and remove roles when necessary.
