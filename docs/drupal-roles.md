## Drupal User Roles


#### About Drupal Roles 

One of the core methods to administer content permissions in Drupal is by the grouping of roles. Rather than assigning individual permissions to each user, permissions are assigned to roles, and roles are assigned to users. Using roles gives administrators greater control over permissions, making it easy to assign and remove roles when necessary. 

#### Roles & Permissions assigned to this project
